üöÄ How to Run the App Locally
To get the application running on your local machine, follow these steps.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or later recommended)

A Neon account to host the PostgreSQL database.

1. Clone & Setup
First, clone the repository and set up the project structure as described in the setup guide.

2. Backend Setup (server)
Navigate to the server directory:

cd rural_connect/server

Create a .env file and add your Neon database connection string and a JWT secret:

# server/.env
DATABASE_URL="your_neon_postgresql_connection_string"
JWT_SECRET="choose_a_strong_secret_key"

Install the dependencies:

npm install

Run the database schema SQL from the setup guide in your Neon SQL editor to create the tables.

Start the backend server:

node index.js

The server will be running on http://localhost:5000.

3. Frontend Setup (client)
Open a new terminal window and navigate to the client directory:

cd rural_connect/client

Create a new environment file for the frontend. In your terminal, run:

touch .env

Add the backend API URL to this new .env file. This prevents hardcoding the URL in your components.

# client/.env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

Install the dependencies:

npm install

Start the React development server:

npm run dev

The application will open in your browser, usually at http://localhost:5173.
